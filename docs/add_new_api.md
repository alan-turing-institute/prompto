# Instructions to add new API/model

The `prompto` library supports querying multiple LLM API endpoints asynchronously (see [available APIs](./../README.md#available-apis-and-models) and the [model docs](./models.md)). However, the list of available APIs is far from complete! As we don't have access to every API available, we need your help to implement them and welcome contributions to the library! It might also be the case that an API has been implemented, but perhaps it needs to updated or improved.

In this document, we aim to capture some key steps to add a new API/model to the library. We hope that this will develop into a helpful guide.

For a guide to contributing to the library in general, see our [contribution guide](./contribution.md). If you have any suggestions or corrections, please feel free to contribute!
