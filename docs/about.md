# About

`prompto` is a Python library written by the [Research Engineering Team (REG)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). It was originally written by [Ryan Chan](https://github.com/rchan26), [Federico Nanni](https://github.com/fedenanni) and [Evelina Gabasova](https://github.com/evelinag).

The library is designed to facilitate the running of language model experiments stored as jsonl files. It automates querying API endpoints and logs progress asynchronously. The library is designed to be extensible and can be used to query different models.
