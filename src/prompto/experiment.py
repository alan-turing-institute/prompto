        Send request to generate response from a LLM and record the response in a jsonl file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prompt_dict : dict
            Dictionary containing the prompt and other parameters to be
            used for text generation. Required keys are "prompt" and "api".
            Optionally can have a "parameters" key. Some APIs may have
            other specific required keys
        experiment : Experiment
            The experiment that is being processed
        index : int | None, optional
            The index of the prompt in the experiment,
            by default None. If None, then index is set to "NA".
            Useful for tagging the prompt/response received and any errors
        attempt : int
            The attempt number to process the prompt

        Returns
        -------
        dict | Exception
            Completed prompt_dict with "response" key storing the response(s)

            was caught but we have attempt==max_attempts).
            An Exception is returned (not raised) if an error is caught and we have
            attempt < max_attempts, indicating that we could try this
            prompt again later in the queue.
