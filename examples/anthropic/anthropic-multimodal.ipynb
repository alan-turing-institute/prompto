    "\n",
    "For the [Anthropic API](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/prompto/docs/anthropic/), there are two environment variables that could be set:\n",

    "As mentioned in the [environment variables docs](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/prompto/docs/environment_variables/#model-specific-environment-variables), there are also model-specific environment variables too which can be utilised. In particular, when you specify a `model_name` key in a prompt dict, one could also specify a `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_model_name` environment variable to indicate the API key used for that particular model (where \"model_name\" is replaced to whatever the corresponding value of the `model_name` key is). We will see a concrete example of this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set environment variables, one can simply have these in a `.env` file which specifies these environment variables as key-value pairs:\n",

    "## Types of prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Anthropic API, the prompt (given via the `\"prompt\"` key in the prompt dict) can take several forms:\n",
    "- a string: a single prompt to obtain a response for\n",
    "- a list of strings: a sequence of prompts to send to the model\n",
    "    - this is useful in the use case of simulating a conversation with the model by defining the user prompts sequentially\n",
    "- a list of dictionaries with keys \"role\" and \"content\", where \"role\" is one of \"user\", \"assistant\", or \"system\" and \"content\" is the message\n",
    "    - this is useful in the case of passing in some conversation history or to pass in a system prompt to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multimodal prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "For prompting the model with multimodal inputs, we use this last format where we define a prompt by specifying the role of the prompt and then a list of parts that make up the prompt. Individual pieces of the part can be text, images or video which are passed to the model as a multimodal input. In this setting, the prompt can be defined flexibly with text interspersed with images or video.\n",
    "\n",
    "When specifying an individual part of the prompt, we define this using a dictionary with keys:\n",
    "- `\"type\"` is one of `\"text\"` or `\"image\"`\n",
    "- if `\"type\"` is `\"text\"`, then you must have a \"text\" key with the text content\n",
    "- if `\"type\"` is `\"image\"`, then you must have a `\"source\"` key. This must also be a dictionary with keys \"media\" specifying the [local path](#specifying-local-files) of an image and \"media_type\" specifying the type of media (e.g. `\"image/jpeg\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to how you'd set up a multimodal prompt for the Anthropic API (see [Anthropic's documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/vision)).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass in a string which will be taken as a text prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a multimodal prompt is the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"role\": \"user\",\n",
    "        \"content\": [\n",
    "            \"what is in this image?\",\n",
    "            {\"type\": \"image\", \"source\": {\"media\": \"image.jpg\", \"media_type\": \"image/jpeg\"}},\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    },\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have a list of one dictionary where we specify the \"role\" as \"user\" and \"content\" as a list of two elements: the first specifies a text string and the second is a dictionary specifying an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we have created an input file in [data/input/anthropic-multimodal-example.jsonl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/prompto/blob/main/examples/anthropic/data/input/anthropic-multimodal-example.jsonl) with several multimodal prompts with local files as an illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying local files\n",
    "\n",
    "When specifying the local files, the file paths must be relative file paths to the `media/` folder in the data folder. For example, if you have an image file `image.jpg` in the `media/` folder, you would specify this as `\"source\": \"image.jpg\"` in the prompt. If you have a video file `video.mp4` in the `media/videos/` folder, you would specify this as `\"source\": \"videos/video.mp4\"` in the prompt."
