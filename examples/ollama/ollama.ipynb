    "When using `prompto` to query models from the Ollama API, lines in our experiment `.jsonl` files must have `\"api\": \"ollama\"` in the prompt dict. \n",

    "## Setting up Ollama locally\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we assume that you have a local instance of the Ollama API running. For installing Ollama, please refer to the [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/). Once you have it installed and have it running, e.g. with `ollama serve` in the terminal, you can proceed with the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the address and port that Ollama uses when running is `localhost:11434`. When developing this notebook, we were running Ollama locally so we set the `OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT` to `http://localhost:11434`. If you are running the server at a different address or port, you can specify with the `OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT` environment variable accordingly as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook and our example experiment file ([data/input/ollama-example.jsonl](./data/input/ollama-example.jsonl)), we have set to query from Llama 3, phi-3 and Gemma models - note that Ollama defaults to the smaller versions of these (8B, 3B, 2B). You can download these models using the following commands in the terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ollama pull llama3\n",
    "ollama pull phi3\n",
    "ollama pull gemma\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd prefer to query other models, you can replace the model names in the experiment file with the models you have downloaded. We simply return an error if the model is not found in the Ollama endpoint that is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For the [Ollama API](../../docs/models.md#ollama), there are two environment variables that could be set:\n",
    "- `OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT`: the API key for the Ollama API\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the [model docs](../../docs/models.md#model-specific-environment-variables), there are also model-specific environment variables too which can be utilised. In particular, if you specify a `model_name` key in a prompt dict, one could also specify a `OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT_model_name` environment variable to indicate the API key used for that particular model (where \"model_name\" is replaced to whatever the corresponding value of the `model_name` key is). We will see a concrete example of this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set environment variables, one can simply have these in a `.env` file which specifies these environment variables as key-value pairs:\n",
    "```\n",
    "OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT=<YOUR-OLLAMA-ENDPOINT>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make this file, you can run the following which should return `True` if it's found one, or `False` otherwise:"
