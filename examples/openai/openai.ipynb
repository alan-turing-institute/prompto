    "- `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`: the default model name for the OpenAI API (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the [model docs](../../docs/models.md#model-specific-environment-variables), there are also model-specific environment variables too which can be utilised. In particular, if you specify a `model_name` key in a prompt dict, one could also specify a `OPENAI_API_KEY_model_name` environment variable to indicate the API key used for that particular model (where \"model_name\" is replaced to whatever the corresponding value of the `model_name` key is). We will see a concrete example of this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` is optional since you can simply specify `model_name` to each prompt dict that has `\"api\": \"openai\"`.\n",

       "   'response': [\"International trade creates jobs through several mechanisms:\\n\\n1. **Market Expansion:**\\n   - **Increased Demand:** By allowing access to international markets, businesses can sell their products and services to a larger customer base. This higher demand often necessitates increased production, leading to the creation of more jobs.\\n   - **Economies of Scale:** As companies expand their operations to meet global demand, they often achieve economies of scale, reducing per-unit costs. This can lead to increased profitability and further expansion, driving job creation.\\n\\n2. **Efficiency and Specialization:**\\n   - **Comparative Advantage:** Countries tend to specialize in the production of goods and services where they have a comparative advantage. This specialization can lead to more efficient resource use and greater productivity, which often translates into more and better-paying jobs.\\n   - **Productivity Gains:** As competition intensifies and firms strive to improve efficiency, productivity often increases. Improved productivity can lead to higher wages and job growth.\\n\\n3. **Foreign Direct Investment:**\\n   - **Inward Investment:** Trade openness often attracts foreign direct investment (FDI), as multinational companies establish operations in new markets. This investment can create jobs directly in sectors like manufacturing, services, and technology.\\n   - **Spillover Effects:** FDI can also have spillover effects, such as the transfer of technology and skills, which can stimulate job creation in related industries and sectors.\\n\\n4. **Export-Oriented Jobs:**\\n   - **Direct Employment:** Companies involved in export activities, such as manufacturing firms, logistics providers, and export services, often require additional staff to handle increased activity from international trade.\\n   - **Indirect Employment:** Supporting industries (such as packaging, transportation, and marketing) also benefit from trade, leading to job creation in these sectors.\\n\\n5. **Import-Driven Jobs:**\\n   - **Consumer Goods:** The availability of imported goods can increase consumer spending power and demand, potentially leading to job creation in retail and other service sectors.\\n   - **Intermediate Goods:** Importing intermediate goods (components used in the production of final goods) can reduce production costs, enhance competitiveness, and stimulate job growth in domestic manufacturing.\\n\\n6. **Innovation and Competitiveness:**\\n   - **Technological Advancements:** Exposure to global competition can drive innovation as firms strive to maintain competitiveness. This encourages the development of new products and services, potentially creating jobs in research, development, and other high-skill areas.\\n   - **Skill Development:** International trade can lead to a more dynamic labor market where workers gain new skills and expertise, making them more employable in various industries.\\n\\n7. **Service Sector Growth:**\\n   - **Expanding Services:** With globalization, there is a growing demand for services such as finance, insurance, travel, and professional services. These sectors often expand alongside increased international trade, creating numerous job opportunities.\\n\\nIn essence, international trade helps to allocate resources more efficiently, stimulates economic growth, and fosters an environment where businesses can thrive and create jobs. However, it's important to note that the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed, and some workers and industries may face challenges due to increased competition and shifting economic landscapes.\",\n",
