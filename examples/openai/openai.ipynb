In particular, when you specify a `model_name` key in a prompt dict, one could also specify a `OPENAI_API_KEY_model_name` environment variable to indicate the API key used for that particular model (where \"model_name\" is replaced to whatever the corresponding value of the `model_name` key is). We will see a concrete example of this later.\n",
