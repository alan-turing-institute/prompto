This increased demand often leads to higher production levels, which in turn requires more workers, thus creating jobs.\n\n2. **Specialization and Efficiency**: International trade encourages countries to specialize in the production of goods and services that they can produce most efficiently. This specialization often leads to the growth of industries", "Sure, here's a light-hearted take on it:\n\nWhy did the factory worker love international trade?\n\nBecause it meant they were getting shipped all over the world!"]}
