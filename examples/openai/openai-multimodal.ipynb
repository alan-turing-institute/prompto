In particular, when you specify a `model_name` key in a prompt dict, one could also specify a `OPENAI_API_KEY_model_name` environment variable to indicate the API key used for that particular model (where \"model_name\" is replaced to whatever the corresponding value of the `model_name` key is). We will see a concrete example of this later.\n",

    "## Types of prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "With the OpenAI API, the prompt (given via the `\"prompt\"` key in the prompt dict) can take several forms:\n",
    "- a string: a single prompt to obtain a response for\n",
    "- a list of strings: a sequence of prompts to send to the model\n",
    "    - this is useful in the use case of simulating a conversation with the model by defining the user prompts sequentially\n",
    "- a list of dictionaries with keys \"role\" and \"content\", where \"role\" is one of \"user\", \"assistant\", or \"system\" and \"content\" is the message\n",
    "    - this is useful in the case of passing in some conversation history or to pass in a system prompt to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created an input file in [data/input/openai-example.jsonl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/prompto/blob/main/examples/openai/data/input/openai-example.jsonl) with an example of each of these cases as an illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multimodal prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "For prompting the model with multimodal inputs, we use this last format where we define a prompt by specifying the role of the prompt and then a list of parts that make up the prompt. Individual pieces of the part can be text, images or video which are passed to the model as a multimodal input. In this setting, the prompt can be defined flexibly with text interspersed with images or video.\n",
    "\n",
    "When specifying an individual part of the prompt, we define this using a dictionary with the keys \"type\" and \"media\". There also may sometimes need to be a \"mime_type\" key too:\n",
    "- `\"type\"` is one of `\"text\"` or `\"image_url\"`\n",
    "- if `\"type\"` is `\"text\"`, then you must have a \"text\" key with the text content\n",
    "- if `\"type\"` is `\"image_url\"`, then you must have a `\"image_url\"` key. This can either just be a string specifying either a [local path](#specifying-local-files) or a URL to an image (starting with \"https://\"), or is itself a dictionary with keys \"url\" specifying the image, and (optionally) \"detail\" which can be \"low\", \"high\" or \"auto\" (default \"auto\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to how you'd set up a multimodal prompt for the OpenAI API (see [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision)).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a multimodal prompt is the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"role\": \"user\",\n",
    "        \"content\": [\n",
    "            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What’s in this image?\"},\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                \"type\": \"image_url\",\n",
    "                \"image_url\": {\n",
    "                    \"url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg\"\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            },\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    },\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have a list of one dictionary where we specify the \"role\" as \"user\" and \"content\" as a list of two elements: the first specifies a text string and the second is a dictionary specifying an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "To specify this same prompt, we could also have directly passed in the URL as the value for the \"image_url\" key:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"role\": \"user\",\n",
    "        \"content\": [\n",
    "            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What’s in this image?\"},\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                \"type\": \"image_url\",\n",
    "                \"image_url\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg\"\n",
