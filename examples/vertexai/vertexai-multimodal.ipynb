    "## Types of prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the [Vertex AI notebook](./vertexai.ipynb), with the Vertex AI API, the prompt (given via the `\"prompt\"` key in the prompt dict) can take several forms:\n",
    "- a string: a single prompt to obtain a response for\n",
    "- a list of strings: a sequence of prompts to send to the model\n",
    "    - this is useful in the use case of simulating a conversation with the model by defining the user prompts sequentially\n",
    "- a list of dictionaries with keys \"role\" and \"parts\", where \"role\" is one of \"user\", \"model\", or \"system\" and \"parts\" is the message\n",
    "    - this is useful in the case of passing in some conversation history or to pass in a system prompt to the model\n",
    "    - note that only the prompt in the list can be a system prompt, and the rest must be user or model prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multimodal prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "For prompting the model with multimodal inputs, we use this last format where we define a prompt by specifying the role of the prompt and then a list of parts that make up the prompt. Individual pieces of the part can be text, images or video which are passed to the model as a multimodal input. In this setting, the prompt can be defined flexibly with text interspersed with images or video.\n",
    "\n",
    "When specifying an individual part of the prompt, we define this using a dictionary with the keys \"type\" and \"media\". There also may sometimes need to be a \"mime_type\" key too:\n",
    "- \"type\" is one of \"text\", \"image\", or \"video\"\n",
    "- \"media\" is the actual content of the part - this can be a string for text, or a file path for images or video. Alternatively, this can be a Google Storage URI for images or video, e.g. `gs://bucket-name/path/to/file.jpg`\n",
    "- \"mime_type\" is the MIME type of the media content, e.g. \"image/jpeg\" for JPEG images or \"video/mp4\" for MP4 videos. This is required if the type is a video or if the type is a image and the media is a Google Storage URI. If the type is image and the media is a file path, the MIME type is not necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "For specifying text, you can just have a string, or you can also use this format, e.g. `{ \"type\": \"text\", \"media\": \"some text\" }`. For images or video, you must use the dictionary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a multimodal prompt is the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[{\"role\": \"user\", \"part\": [\"what is in this video?\", {\"type\": \"video\", \"mime_type\": \"video/mp4\", \"media\": \"gs://bucket/GreatRedSpot.mp4\"}]}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have a list of one dictionary where we specify the \"role\" as \"user\" and \"part\" as a list of two elements: the first is a string and the second is a dictionary specifying the type and media content of the part. In this case, the media content is a video file stored in Google Storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we have created an input file in [data/input/vertexai-multimodal-example.jsonl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/prompto/blob/main/examples/vertexai/data/input/vertexai-multimodal-example.jsonl) with several multimodal prompts with local files as an illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying local files\n",
    "\n",
    "When specifying the local files, the file paths must be relative file paths to the `media/` folder in the data folder. For example, if you have an image file `image.jpg` in the `media/` folder, you would specify this as `\"media\": \"image.jpg\"` in the prompt. If you have a video file `video.mp4` in the `media/videos/` folder, you would specify this as `\"media\": \"videos/video.mp4\"` in the prompt."
