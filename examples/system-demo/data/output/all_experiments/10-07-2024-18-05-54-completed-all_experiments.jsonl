Question:** What are the main differences between classical and operant conditioning?\n\n**Answer:**  Classical conditioning is a learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a naturally occurring stimulus, leading to a conditioned response. For example, Pavlov's dogs learned to salivate at the sound of a bell because it was repeatedly paired with food. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, involves learning through reinforcement and punishment.
